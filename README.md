Running

Its very simple to run this script. 

create a file website.txt which will contains the list of the URL you want to check.
format of website should be like this: Google.co.in(this is an example)
there should be only one url in one line.
As we are adding http in every URL before parsing it so there should not be any http in your url in file.
make sure you will create the file at same location from where you are running this script.
Output file web_crawl.txt will be auto generated at the same location from where you are running this script.

then atlast type python test.py in cmd. 

usally if there are more website it will take some time to get the result.
